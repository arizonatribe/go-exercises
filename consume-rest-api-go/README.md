# Consume a REST API in Go

Working through [this tutorial](https://www.soberkoder.com/consume-rest-api-go/) published by [SoberKoder](https://github.com/soberkoder)

It leverages a free REST API which can generate very basic fake data (users, blog posts, etc.), called [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The schema it provides from the `/users` endpoint looks like this:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

‚òù Although this schema was converted to a Go `struct` manually, the author mentioned services like [json-to-go](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/) can be used to convert JSON payload types to Golang structs automatically.

Packages used:
- Encoding and decoding (serialization and de-serialization) is accomplished through the `encoding/json` package
- Byte slice handling is through the `bytes` package
- Logging is handled through the `log` package
- Formatting of strings and printing to the console is handled through the `fmt` package
- File reading/writing is handled through `io/ioutil` package
- Running an HTTP server and handling requests/responses is accomplished through the 'net/http' package
